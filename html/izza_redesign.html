        <h1 class="project-header"><strong>About</strong></h1>
        <p>This was a redesign project in my INF132 course where I, and a four
                others, were tasked with choosing a website to redesign. The only
                condition we were given was that the website had to be related to 
                social good. My main role in the project was redesigning the finance
                page. </p>
        <h1 class="projecct-header"><strong>Our Goals</strong></h1>
        <p>1. Improve site consistency and affordances.
                2. Change page hierarchy to reflect what is most important.</p>
        <h1 class="project-header"><strong>Step 1: Getting Permission</strong></h1>
        <p>After choosing the site that my group decided to redesign, we decided to
            contact the owner/founder of Camp Izza, Dr. Omar Ezzeldine. He agreed to
            help us and gave us permission to redesign their site logo as well.
        </p>
        <h1 class="project-header"><strong>Step 2: Collecting Data!</strong></h1>
        <h2><em>User Surveys</em></h2>
        <p>Since this redesign was supposed to enhance user experience, one of our
            goals was to collect user input and analyze what needed changing. My group
            created a Google form where we not only gathered data on the user's themself,
            but also about their experience using Camp Izza's website. There were questions
            that were multiple choice as well as free response. Once the survey was complete,
            we sent it out to potential users, like those who were working parents, grandparents,
            etc.
        </p>
        <h2><em>Creating Personas</em></h2>
        <p>
            The next step we conducted was creating some user personas. For this part, I specifically
            was in charge of creating three different personas. I thought about the type of people
            who would want to use the Camp Izza website, and decided to make a brief outline of who
            those people would be. In the end, I came up with a single mother, a troubled uncle, and 
            a grandparent. 
        </p>
        <h2><em>User Interviews</em></h2>
        <p>
            Our second approach to collecting data consisted of conducting two user 
            interviews. But like what was mentioned above, since we were unable 
            to find real users who interacted with Camp Izza, we could only interview 
            potential users. This also restricted the kinds of questions we could 
            ask since they had never actually used the site before.
