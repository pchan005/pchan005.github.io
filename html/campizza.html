          <p class="section-content">The layout of Camp Izza’s website made it hard for users to find information around
            the site. Along with that, it was also made up of inconsistent components, which is a bad design practice
            which can confuse users. Users also felt that there was a lack of necessary information on the site, 
            which affected their decision making when deciding whether or not they wanted to register for the camp.</p>

          <p class="section-content">For our competitive analysis, I decided to analyze SuperCamp by Quantum Physics, which is an indirect competitor.
            SuperCamp differs from Camp Izza in that its main focus is on educational programs. Camp Izza focuses on
            fun and recreation. After analyzing the site, we found that SuperCamp tried to fit too much information on
            its site, which made it hard to focus on a single thing. This provided us an example of what we didn't want to do for our redesign.

            we discovered was that users were more concerned about who is behind the organization rather than the kind of activities 
            it offered. Throughout the survey, a lot of suggestions the participants made is to add more details to a certain service 
            on Camp Izza’s website and they would not make decisions based on the limited information. This gave us direction on how we
            wanted to make changes to the website.

            account on the site, submit a job application as a summer counselor, and using the calendar on the activities 
          page to find a specific event. Main issues that we found after conducting the walkthroughs was that a lot of 
        information was hidden or hard to find. There is also no information or job description on both the website and the Google 
      Form application, which can deter people from applying.  In sum, although there is some general information about the camp, 
      the website lacks ease of use and the details necessary in order for someone to make an informed decision about enrolling their 
      child, applying for financial aid, or applying for a job.

          <h2 class="section-title">LIMITATIONS</h2>
          <p class="section-content">As we were only given a couple of weeks for the redesign, we were 
            tight on schedule for multiple iterations of designs. Ideally, it would have been good to be 
            able to convene and discuss certain aspects that we enjoyed about each other’s designs, 
            but only a few of us were able to, so there’s a definite stylistic difference between the pages 
            as we designed each individually and put it all together.
            Additionally, although all of us had previous experience using Adobe XD for other classes, the 
            skill level varied from member to member which might be apparent in the flows and interactions 
            in our mock-up between the pages.

          <p class="section-content">In summary, we updated the website to have a more modern visual design, 
            made site navigation easier, and made information more accessible and detailed. We believe that 
            our redesign substantially improves the current Camp Izza website and would increase client 
            interest and retention in the camp. Due to our constraint on time, there was still many other
            aspects of usability that we were unable to explore, but overall, we were able to gain a lot of 
            experience relating to UX research.</p>
